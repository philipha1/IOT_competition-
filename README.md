Smart City 2: Develop a smart solution to support Electric Vehicle (EV) charger management for car parks to address the rising demand for EVs 



In the vibrant city of Hong Kong, the electric vehicle (EV) revolution is picking up pace, 

but it is facing a critical challenge â€“ the scarcity of efficient EV charging infrastructure. 

To solve this problem, we propose a cutting-edge smart solution app designed to optimize charger management, enhance parking operations, and contribute to the evolution of smart cities. 

This project is divided into 2 major sections

Ev car classification using Deep Learning Technology(RestNet-18 model) 

Parking Slot vacancy prediction model using Customer dataset and precipitation rate
